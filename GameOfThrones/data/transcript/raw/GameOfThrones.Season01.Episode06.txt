EDDARD_STARK Your pardon, your Grace. I would rise, but...
CERSEI_LANNISTER Do you know what your wife has done?
EDDARD_STARK She did nothing I did not command.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Who'd have thought she had it in her?
CERSEI_LANNISTER By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
EDDARD_STARK I am the King's Hand, charged with keeping the peace...
CERSEI_LANNISTER You were the King's Hand. You shall now be held accountable.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Will both of you shut your mouths?! Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.
EDDARD_STARK He butchered my men...
CERSEI_LANNISTER Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Quiet, woman.
EDDARD_STARK Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
CERSEI_LANNISTER I took you for a King.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Hold your tongue.
CERSEI_LANNISTER He's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown. I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again. See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not... That was not Kingly.
EDDARD_STARK If we don't act, there will be a war.
ROBERT_BARATHEON So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.
EDDARD_STARK And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
ROBERT_BARATHEON I'm half a Kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters... I can't rule the Kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats. So enough.
EDDARD_STARK As you command, your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Piss on that. Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the King. I get what I want. I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt.
EDDARD_STARK The hunt?
ROBERT_BARATHEON Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.
EDDARD_STARK The Targaryen girl...
ROBERT_BARATHEON Seven hells, don't start with her again. The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.
IRRI Khaleesi? Khaleesi!
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN You're hurt.
ROBB_STARK Not too fast.
BRAN_STARK Come on, Dancer.
THEON_GREYJOY When are you gonna tell him?
ROBB_STARK Not now.
THEON_GREYJOY Blood for blood.
BRAN_STARK Come on!
THEON_GREYJOY You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.
ROBB_STARK You're talking about war.
THEON_GREYJOY I'm talking about justice.
ROBB_STARK Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
THEON_GREYJOY A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him...
ROBB_STARK You want me to march on Casterly Rock?
THEON_GREYJOY You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
ROBB_STARK And it's not your duty, because it's not your House. Where's Bran?
THEON_GREYJOY I don't know. It's not my House.
BRAN_STARK Robb?
OSHA All alone in the deep, dark woods.
BRAN_STARK I'm not alone. My brother is with me.
WILDLING_1 I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
OSHA That's a pretty pin. Silver.
WILDLING_1 We'll take the pin and the horse. Get down. Be quick about it.
BRAN_STARK I can't. The saddle... the straps.
WILDLING_2 What's wrong with you?
WILDLING_1 You some kind of cripple?
BRAN_STARK I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell. If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!
WILDLING_2 Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
OSHA The boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood? Think what Mance would give us.
WILDLING_1 Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far South as South goes. There ain't no White Walkers down in Dorne.
ROBB_STARK Drop the knife! Let him go and I'll let you live.
BRAN_STARK Robb! Robb!
WILDLING_1 Shut up. Drop the blade!
BRAN_STARK No, don't.
WILDLING_1 Do it.
ROBB_STARK Are you all right?
BRAN_STARK Yes. It doesn't hurt.
THEON_GREYJOY Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done.
ROBB_STARK Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
THEON_GREYJOY He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
ROBB_STARK You don't have the right...
THEON_GREYJOY To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.
ROBB_STARK What about her?
OSHA Give me my life, my Lord, and I'm yours.
ROBB_STARK We'll keep her alive.
TYRION_LANNISTER Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
MORD Dwarf man making noise!
TYRION_LANNISTER How would you like to be rich?
MORD Dwarf man still making noise.
TYRION_LANNISTER My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...
MORD No gold!
TYRION_LANNISTER Well, I don't have it here.
MORD No gold. Fuck off.
ARYA_STARK I don't want to practice today.
SYRIO_FOREL No?
ARYA_STARK They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
SYRIO_FOREL You are troubled.
ARYA_STARK Yes.
SYRIO_FOREL Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.
ARYA_STARK I don't like dolls and k...
SYRIO_FOREL You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you are with your trouble when fighting happens... More trouble for you. Just so. How can you be quick as a snake... Or as quiet as a shadow... When you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father. That is right. Do you pray to the Gods?
ARYA_STARK The old and the new.
SYRIO_FOREL There is only one God and his name is Death. And there is only one thing we say to Death: "Not today."
VISERYS_TARGARYEN She has to eat the whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.
JORAH_MORMONT She's doing well.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN She'll never keep it down. Tell me what she's saying.
JORAH_MORMONT "The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of his hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him... And their wives will weep tears of blood." She's going to have a boy.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true Dragon.
JORAH_MORMONT "The stallion who mounts the world." The stallion is the Khal of Khals. He shall unite the people into a single Khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN A Prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
ALL Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego!
VISERYS_TARGARYEN They love her.
JORAH_MORMONT She truly is a queen today.
JORAH_MORMONT Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN It's not my law.
JORAH_MORMONT They don't belong to you.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN Whatever is hers is also mine.
JORAH_MORMONT Once, perhaps.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs... a ship and an army.
JORAH_MORMONT And you have all three.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN I need a large army. I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was five years old... And no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it. How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Who can rule without wealth or fear or love? Oh! You stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be Queen of the savages, and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.
JORAH_MORMONT You can go. You can't have the eggs.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
JORAH_MORMONT It means everything to me.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN And yet here you stand.
JORAH_MORMONT And yet here I stand.
TYRION_LANNISTER Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
MORD Noise again!
TYRION_LANNISTER About the gold...
MORD No gold! No gold.
TYRION_LANNISTER Listen to me! Listen to me. Sometimes possession is an abstract concept... When they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.
MORD Where?
TYRION_LANNISTER Where? I don't know where, but when they free me...
MORD You want free? Go be free.
TYRION_LANNISTER Have you ever heard the phrase "Rich as a Lannister"? Of course you have! You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, "A Lannister always pays his debts." If you deliver a message from me... to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.
MORD What message?
TYRION_LANNISTER Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
LYSA_ARRYN You wish to confess your crimes?
TYRION_LANNISTER Yes my Lady. I do, my Lady.
LYSA_ARRYN The sky cells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your Gods as an honest man.
TYRION_LANNISTER Where do I begin, my Lords and Ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears. If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was 10, I stuffed my Uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice. When I was 12, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
LYSA_ARRYN Silence!
ROBIN_ARRYN What happened next?
LYSA_ARRYN What do you think you're doing?
TYRION_LANNISTER Confessing my crimes.
CATELYN_STARK Lord Tyrion, You are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
TYRION_LANNISTER Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that.
LYSA_ARRYN You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord! Take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.
TYRION_LANNISTER Is this how justice is done in the Vale? You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's justice? I am accused and demand a trial!
LYSA_ARRYN If you're tried and found guilty, then by the King's own laws you will pay with your life.
TYRION_LANNISTER I understand the law.
LYSA_ARRYN We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door. You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgment. Then you will leave... By one door or the other.
TYRION_LANNISTER No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
LYSA_ARRYN You have that right.
KNIGHT_1 My Lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.
KNIGHT_2 The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your Lord husband, let me avenge his death.
KNIGHT_3 I'll fight for you.
KNIGHT_4 It'll be my honor.
KNIGHT_5 The honor should be mine.
ROBIN_ARRYN Make the bad man fly!
LYSA_ARRYN Ser Vardis... You're quiet. Don't you want to avenge my husband?
VARDIS_EGAN With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
TYRION_LANNISTER Agreed.
LYSA_ARRYN You demanded a trial by combat.
TYRION_LANNISTER Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.
VARDIS_EGAN I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.
TYRION_LANNISTER I wouldn't be too glad, Ser. I name my brother Jaime Lannister.
LYSA_ARRYN The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
TYRION_LANNISTER Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.
LYSA_ARRYN The trial will be today.
TYRION_LANNISTER Do I have a volunteer? Anyone? Anyone?
LYSA_ARRYN I think we can assume that no one is willing...
BRONN I'll stand for the dwarf.
LANCEL_LANNISTER More wine, your Grace?
ROBERT_BARATHEON What was I saying?
RENLY_BARATHEON Simpler time.
ROBERT_BARATHEON It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?
BARRISTAN_SELMY It was, your Grace.
ROBERT_BARATHEON The enemy was right in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.
RENLY_BARATHEON It sounds exhilarating.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?
RENLY_BARATHEON Once. I think.
ROBERT_BARATHEON You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We used to call it "making the eight."
RENLY_BARATHEON Those were some lucky girls.
ROBERT_BARATHEON You ever make the eight, Barristan?
BARRISTAN_SELMY I don't believe so, your Grace.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Those were the days.
RENLY_BARATHEON Which days, exactly? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?
ROBERT_BARATHEON Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.
RENLY_BARATHEON I suppose it was all rather heroic... If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight.
LANCEL_LANNISTER More wine, your Grace?
FARMER They burned most everything in the Riverlands - our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women, then they took 'em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE Brigands, most likely.
FARMER They weren't thieves. They didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the King. The King is hunting.
PETYR_BAELISH Fish. The Sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's house... Tully, my Lord Hand?
EDDARD_STARK These men, were they flying a Sigil? A banner?
FARMER None, your... Hand. The one who was leading them... Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
PETYR_BAELISH That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
EDDARD_STARK You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
PETYR_BAELISH I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog. I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the King's protection, it would be...
PETYR_BAELISH That would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
EDDARD_STARK I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life, but perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our King, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion. You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
BERIC_DONDARRION As you command.
EDDARD_STARK In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I charge you to bring the King's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles, of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE My Lord. This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
EDDARD_STARK Grand Maester Pycelle.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE My Lord.
EDDARD_STARK Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to Court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.
PETYR_BAELISH A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.
EDDARD_STARK Then how come Robert is King and not Tywin Lannister?
ROBIN_ARRYN Fight!
LYSA_ARRYN Stand and fight, coward!
TYRION_LANNISTER Yes!
LYSA_ARRYN Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.
ROBIN_ARRYN Is it over?
LYSA_ARRYN You don't fight with honor!
BRONN No. He did.
ROBIN_ARRYN Can I make the little man fly now?
TYRION_LANNISTER Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine. A Lannister always pays his debts.
SEPTA_MORDANE You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
SANSA_STARK Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South.
SEPTA_MORDANE It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
SANSA_STARK My mother isn't from the North.
SEPTA_MORDANE I'm aware of that.
SANSA_STARK Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
SEPTA_MORDANE Yes, I have hair.
SANSA_STARK I've never seen it.
SEPTA_MORDANE Would you like to?
SANSA_STARK No. Where are you from anyway? The North or the South?
SEPTA_MORDANE I come from a very small village in...
SANSA_STARK Oh, wait. I just realized I don't care.
SEPTA_MORDANE Sansa...
SANSA_STARK Septa.
SEPTA_MORDANE Now you are being rude. My Prince.
SANSA_STARK My Prince.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON My Lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
SANSA_STARK It's beautiful, like the one your mother wears.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON You'll be Queen someday. It's only fitting you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?
SANSA_STARK There's nothing to forgive.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON You're my Lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the Salt Shore in the South, and you will be Queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my Lady now, from this day until my last day.
THEON_GREYJOY Stop! Stop! What are you doing?
ROS Going to King's Landing.
THEON_GREYJOY In a turnip cart?
ROS I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
THEON_GREYJOY You can afford that?
ROS Some of my friends are more generous than others.
THEON_GREYJOY There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
ROS So I'll have lots of company.
THEON_GREYJOY Yes, you'll be very popular. Until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
ROS And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy? Mistress of the Iron Islands?
THEON_GREYJOY Don't be a fool.
ROS I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon. Most of them will never come back. There's nothing left for me here. Let's go, Stefon.
THEON_GREYJOY Let me see it one more time!
ROS See what?
THEON_GREYJOY I'm going to miss you.
ROS I know.
EDDARD_STARK I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
SANSA_STARK What?
EDDARD_STARK Listen.
SANSA_STARK What about Joffrey?
ARYA_STARK Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?
EDDARD_STARK What? No!
SANSA_STARK Please, father.
ARYA_STARK You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
EDDARD_STARK This isn't a punishment. I want you back for your own safety.
ARYA_STARK Can we take Syrio back with us?
SANSA_STARK Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen and have his babies.
ARYA_STARK Seven hells.
EDDARD_STARK When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone brave, gentle and strong...
SANSA_STARK I don't want someone brave, gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest King that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
ARYA_STARK The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father.
SANSA_STARK He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk King.
EDDARD_STARK Go on girls, get your Septa and start packing your things.
ARYA_STARK Come on.
SANSA_STARK But it's not fair!
EDDARD_STARK Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair. Axel Baratheon, black of hair. Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair. Steffon Baratheon, black of hair. Robert Baratheon, black of hair. Joffrey Baratheon... Golden-haired.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN Daenerys! Where's my sister?
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Stop him.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN Where is she? Where is she? I'm here for the feast. The whore's feast?
JORAH_MORMONT Come.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN Get your hands off me! No one touches the Dragon! Khal Drogo! I'm here for the feast.
JORAH_MORMONT Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN That is no place for a King.
KHAL_DROGO You are no King.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN Keep away from me!
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Viserys! Please.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN There she is.
JORAH_MORMONT Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN They can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you. Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him. What's he saying?
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN He says yes. You shall have a golden crown... that men shall tremble to behold.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN That was all I wanted. What was promised. No. No! You cannot touch me. I am the Dragon. I'm a dragon! I want my crown!
JORAH_MORMONT Look away, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN No.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN No, no. Dany, tell them. Make them! Make them... No, you can't! Dany, please!
KHAL_DROGO A crown for a King.
JORAH_MORMONT Khaleesi?
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN He was no Dragon. Fire cannot kill a Dragon.
