KINGS_LANDING_PAGE Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.
EDDARD_STARK Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.
JORY_CASSEL Yes, my Lord.
KINGS_LANDING_PAGE If you'd like to change into something more appropriate...
JAIME_LANNISTER Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.
EDDARD_STARK Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
JAIME_LANNISTER Sturdy old thing. How many kings' arses have polished it, I wonder? And what's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.
EDDARD_STARK Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
JAIME_LANNISTER I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
EDDARD_STARK You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
JAIME_LANNISTER I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.
EDDARD_STARK But you just stood there and watched.
JAIME_LANNISTER 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.
EDDARD_STARK Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
JAIME_LANNISTER Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
EDDARD_STARK You served him well when serving was safe.
VARYS Lord Stark.
EDDARD_STARK Lord Varys.
VARYS I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
EDDARD_STARK A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
RENLY_BARATHEON And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...
PETYR_BAELISH But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
EDDARD_STARK She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
PETYR_BAELISH All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
EDDARD_STARK Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
PETYR_BAELISH It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
EDDARD_STARK Grand Maester.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE How many years has it been? You were a young man.
EDDARD_STARK And you served another King.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?
EDDARD_STARK Without the King?
RENLY_BARATHEON Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
VARYS His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
PETYR_BAELISH We are the lords of small matters here.
RENLY_BARATHEON My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
PETYR_BAELISH Mmm, how much?
EDDARD_STARK 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE Can the treasury bear such expense?
PETYR_BAELISH I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80 000?
EDDARD_STARK Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
PETYR_BAELISH I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
EDDARD_STARK How could you let this happen?
PETYR_BAELISH The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
EDDARD_STARK I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.
RENLY_BARATHEON "Counting coppers," he calls it.
EDDARD_STARK I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
PETYR_BAELISH As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.
EDDARD_STARK There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.
VARYS You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.
CERSEI_LANNISTER Please, it's nearly healed.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON It's ugly.
CERSEI_LANNISTER A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
CERSEI_LANNISTER That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON Do I have to marry her?
CERSEI_LANNISTER Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON I don't want to.
CERSEI_LANNISTER No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
CERSEI_LANNISTER How would you handle them?
JOFFREY_BARATHEON I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.
CERSEI_LANNISTER A royal army?
JOFFREY_BARATHEON Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
CERSEI_LANNISTER And if the northerners rebel?
JOFFREY_BARATHEON I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.
CERSEI_LANNISTER And these 10 000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
JOFFREY_BARATHEON For me. I'm their King.
CERSEI_LANNISTER But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON I'm not asking.
CERSEI_LANNISTER The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.
JOFFREY_BARATHEON So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
CERSEI_LANNISTER Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
SEPTA_MORDANE Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.
ARYA_STARK I'm practicing.
SANSA_STARK Practicing for what?
ARYA_STARK The Prince.
SEPTA_MORDANE Arya, stop!
ARYA_STARK He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
SANSA_STARK The Hound killed your friend.
ARYA_STARK The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
SANSA_STARK You're an idiot.
ARYA_STARK You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
SEPTA_MORDANE Enough!
EDDARD_STARK What's happening here?
SEPTA_MORDANE Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
EDDARD_STARK Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love. The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
SANSA_STARK I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
SEPTA_MORDANE You've barely eaten a thing.
EDDARD_STARK It's all right. Go on. War was easier than daughters.
ARYA_STARK Go away!
EDDARD_STARK Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?
ARYA_STARK Mine.
EDDARD_STARK Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
ARYA_STARK I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
EDDARD_STARK Come here. Now what do you want with this?
ARYA_STARK It's called Needle.
EDDARD_STARK A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
ARYA_STARK Stick 'em with the pointy end.
EDDARD_STARK That's the essence of it.
ARYA_STARK I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
EDDARD_STARK No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.
ARYA_STARK I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.
EDDARD_STARK Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
ARYA_STARK So was I! He is a liar.
EDDARD_STARK Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.
ARYA_STARK But how you can let her marry someone like that?
EDDARD_STARK Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
ARYA_STARK Winter is coming.
EDDARD_STARK You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.
ARYA_STARK I don't hate her. Not really.
EDDARD_STARK I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.
ARYA_STARK I can keep it?
EDDARD_STARK Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.
OLD_NAN Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
BRAN_STARK I hate your stories.
OLD_NAN I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
BRAN_STARK Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
OLD_NAN Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds...
ROBB_STARK What are you telling him now?
OLD_NAN Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
ROBB_STARK Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.
OLD_NAN Maybe we do.
ROBB_STARK How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? Bran, I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.
BRAN_STARK I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.
ROBB_STARK Don't ever say that.
BRAN_STARK I'd rather be dead.
RODRIK_CASSEL Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.
CATELYN_STARK It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
RODRIK_CASSEL My Lady.
GUARD Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?
CATELYN_STARK I would. We've done nothing wrong.
GUARD We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
CATELYN_STARK Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...
GUARD Follow me, Lady Stark.
PETYR_BAELISH Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
CATELYN_STARK You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a...
PETYR_BAELISH I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
CATELYN_STARK How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
PETYR_BAELISH No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
CATELYN_STARK How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
PETYR_BAELISH A dear friend told me.
VARYS Lady Stark.
CATELYN_STARK Lord Varys.
VARYS To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
CATELYN_STARK How did you know I was coming?
VARYS Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.
CATELYN_STARK Do you know whose dagger this is?
VARYS I must admit I do not.
PETYR_BAELISH Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.
CATELYN_STARK Yours?
PETYR_BAELISH At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
CATELYN_STARK To whom?
PETYR_BAELISH Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
ALLISER_THORNE Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of. If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us? Next! Next! Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.
TYRION_LANNISTER A charming man.
JEOR_MORMONT I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
TYRION_LANNISTER And how's that going, Commander Mormont?
JEOR_MORMONT Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
TYRION_LANNISTER Good news or bad?
JEOR_MORMONT Both.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
PETYR_BAELISH Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
EDDARD_STARK My wife is in Winterfell.
PETYR_BAELISH Is she?
PETYR_BAELISH I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
EDDARD_STARK You're a funny man. A very funny man.
CATELYN_STARK Ned!
PETYR_BAELISH Ah, the Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.
GRENN You broke my nose, bastard!
JON_SNOW It's an improvement.
GRENN If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.
PYPAR I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
GRENN What're you looking at, Half Man?
TYRION_LANNISTER I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Hmm. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
RAST What do you care about our faces?
TYRION_LANNISTER It's just I think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.
GRENN We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
JON_SNOW Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
TYRION_LANNISTER Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.
JON_SNOW They hate me because I'm better than they are.
TYRION_LANNISTER It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Oh... Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
PETYR_BAELISH The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
CATELYN_STARK We have proof. We have the blade.
PETYR_BAELISH Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.
CATELYN_STARK Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
PETYR_BAELISH I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
CATELYN_STARK I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
PETYR_BAELISH Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
CERSEI_LANNISTER How could you be so stupid?
JAIME_LANNISTER Calm down.
CERSEI_LANNISTER He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
JAIME_LANNISTER I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
CERSEI_LANNISTER Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
JAIME_LANNISTER Then what are you raving about?
CERSEI_LANNISTER What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
JAIME_LANNISTER We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
CERSEI_LANNISTER And my husband?
JAIME_LANNISTER I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us: "The War for Cersei's Cunt."
CERSEI_LANNISTER Let me go.
JAIME_LANNISTER Never.
CERSEI_LANNISTER Let me go.
JAIME_LANNISTER The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.
CATELYN_STARK I wish I could see the girls.
EDDARD_STARK It's too dangerous.
CATELYN_STARK Just for a moment.
EDDARD_STARK Until we know who our enemies are...
CATELYN_STARK I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.
EDDARD_STARK Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
CATELYN_STARK And if you find the proof?
EDDARD_STARK Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
CATELYN_STARK My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
EDDARD_STARK He still loves you.
CATELYN_STARK Does he?
EDDARD_STARK Off with you.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Yes, it's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
BARRISTAN_SELMY Of course, your Grace.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Who was it?
BARRISTAN_SELMY A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
ROBERT_BARATHEON How'd you do it?
BARRISTAN_SELMY Lance through the heart.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I br ought it down he shouted, "Wait! Wait." They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
LANCEL_LANNISTER It's empty, your Grace.
ROBERT_BARATHEON What do you mean it's empty?
LANCEL_LANNISTER There's no more wine.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Is that what empty means? So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
JAIME_LANNISTER One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
BARRISTAN_SELMY I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.
JAIME_LANNISTER You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
BARRISTAN_SELMY A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
ROBERT_BARATHEON Your outlaw... Any last words?
JAIME_LANNISTER I cut his head off, so no.
ROBERT_BARATHEON What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
JAIME_LANNISTER He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... "Burn them all." If that's all, your Grace...
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
JORAH_MORMONT The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN From whom?
JORAH_MORMONT If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices - pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Tell them all to stop.
JORAH_MORMONT You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Until I command them otherwise.
JORAH_MORMONT You're learning to talk like a Queen.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
IRRI Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN No!
IRRI Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
VISERYS_TARGARYEN Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
JORAH_MORMONT Shall we return to the Khalasar? Khaleesi?
RAKHARO You walk.
BENJEN_STARK I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
JON_SNOW You're leaving?
BENJEN_STARK I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
JON_SNOW What kind of reports?
BENJEN_STARK The kind I don't want to believe.
JON_SNOW I'm ready. I won't let you down.
BENJEN_STARK You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.
JON_SNOW But I'm better than every...
BENJEN_STARK Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.
YOREN A bear's balls.
TYRION_LANNISTER You're joking?
YOREN And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.
TYRION_LANNISTER And how do a bear's balls taste?
YOREN A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
TYRION_LANNISTER Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
YOREN But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
TYRION_LANNISTER They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
BENJEN_STARK The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
TYRION_LANNISTER You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.
BENJEN_STARK I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
TYRION_LANNISTER Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
BENJEN_STARK Call me what you like.
TYRION_LANNISTER I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
BENJEN_STARK You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts.
TYRION_LANNISTER But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.
BENJEN_STARK You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.
YOREN Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.
BENJEN_STARK Enjoy the capital, brother.
YOREN I always do.
TYRION_LANNISTER I think he's starting to like me. "Going below"?
YOREN Aye. Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
TYRION_LANNISTER So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
YOREN Aye, day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
TYRION_LANNISTER Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
YOREN I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.
TYRION_LANNISTER Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
IRRI Yes, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN What are you doing?
IRRI When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion.
JORAH_MORMONT For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.
RAKHARO Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.
JORAH_MORMONT Armor.
RAKHARO Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
JORAH_MORMONT Slow.
RAKHARO Slow.
JORAH_MORMONT It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.
RAKHARO My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
JORAH_MORMONT I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
RAKHARO He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
JORAH_MORMONT He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
IRRI The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
RAKHARO There are no rabbits.
IRRI Find some ducks, she likes ducks.
RAKHARO Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
IRRI Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
JORAH_MORMONT I don't think she wants to eat dog.
IRRI The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
RAKHARO A blessing from the Great Stallion.
IRRI She does not want to eat horse.
JORAH_MORMONT I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
RAKHARO We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
JORAH_MORMONT Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
JON_SNOW Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
MAESTER_AEMON How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
TYRION_LANNISTER Eight... no, nine.
MAESTER_AEMON All of them brief?
TYRION_LANNISTER They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.
MAESTER_AEMON This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually - winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.
JEOR_MORMONT We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.
TYRION_LANNISTER Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.
JEOR_MORMONT One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
MAESTER_AEMON The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
JEOR_MORMONT Your sister sits by the side the King. Tell her we need help.
MAESTER_AEMON When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN It’s a boy.
KHAL_DROGO How do you know?
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN I know.
JON_SNOW I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.
TYRION_LANNISTER It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
JON_SNOW Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
TYRION_LANNISTER I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
JON_SNOW If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.
TYRION_LANNISTER Of course.
JON_SNOW He'll never walk again.
TYRION_LANNISTER If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.
JON_SNOW Farewell, My Lord.
SYRIO_FOREL You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
ARYA_STARK Who are you?
SYRIO_FOREL Your dancing master, Syrio Forel. Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.
ARYA_STARK It's too heavy.
SYRIO_FOREL It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body sideface. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
ARYA_STARK What if I drop it?
SYRIO_FOREL The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.
ARYA_STARK I'm a girl.
SYRIO_FOREL Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...
ARYA_STARK A Needle.
SYRIO_FOREL Ahhh. Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me. Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.
