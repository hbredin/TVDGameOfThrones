VARYS You've seen better days, My Lord.
EDDARD_STARK Another visit? It seems you're my last friend.
VARYS No no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
EDDARD_STARK On her knees, begging for me, hmmm. Did you laugh with the others?
VARYS You do me wrong, My Lord. Your blood is the last thing I want.
EDDARD_STARK I don't know what you want. I've given up trying to guess.
VARYS When I was still a boy ... before they cut my balls off with a hot knife ... I traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. I am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. I'm a good actor, My Lord.
EDDARD_STARK Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
VARYS I could. But will I? No. As I said, I'm no hero.
EDDARD_STARK What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories ... tell me, what do you want?
VARYS Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad ... fighting for his father's freedom.
EDDARD_STARK Robb? He's just a boy.
VARYS Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the King's ... the late King's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the Throne, he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
EDDARD_STARK Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The Throne is his by rights.
VARYS Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life, it would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
EDDARD_STARK You want me to serve the woman who murdered my King, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
VARYS I want you to serve the realm! Tell the Queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. If you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave, I believe she will allow you to take the Black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
EDDARD_STARK You think my life is some precious thing to me? That I would trade my honor for a few more years of... Of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learned it well. But I grew up with soldiers. I learned how to die a long time ago.
VARYS Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, My Lord? Is that a precious thing to you?
ROBB_STARK It's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
THEON_GREYJOY Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
CATELYN_STARK Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
ROBB_STARK He's grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
JON_UMBER Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
ROBB_STARK Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
THEON_GREYJOY Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
RODRIK_CASSEL Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
CATELYN_STARK The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.
ROBB_STARK Have my horse saddled and ready.
JON_UMBER Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannis.
THEON_GREYJOY Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
ROBB_STARK My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.
CATELYN_STARK I agree. I'll go.
THEON_GREYJOY You can't!
CATELYN_STARK I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl. He would never harm me.
JON_UMBER Unless there was a profit in it.
WALDER_FREY What do you want?
CATELYN_STARK It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, My Lord.
WALDER_FREY Oh spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am I supposed to do with you?
FREY_SON_1 Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here ...
WALDER_FREY Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until I die. Do I look dead to you?
FREY_SON_2 Father, please ...
WALDER_FREY I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if I hadn't squirted you into her belly. All right, you come forward. There. Now that I've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.
CATELYN_STARK Is there somewhere we can talk?
WALDER_FREY We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you! You too. You see that? 15 she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine.
CATELYN_STARK I'm sure she will give you many sons.
WALDER_FREY Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
CATELYN_STARK He is quite ill, My Lord.
WALDER_FREY Didn't come to the last one either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.
CATELYN_STARK My Lord, I ...
WALDER_FREY Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
CATELYN_STARK I'm sure there were reasons why ...
WALDER_FREY I didn't need reasons. I needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
CATELYN_STARK To ask you to open your gates, My Lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
WALDER_FREY Why should I let him?
CATELYN_STARK If you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.
WALDER_FREY They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.
CATELYN_STARK You swore an oath to my father.
WALDER_FREY Oh yes, I said some words... And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right. Joffrey's King now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. If I had the sense the Gods gave a fish, I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.
CATELYN_STARK Why don't you?
WALDER_FREY Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon, give me one good reason why I should waste a single thought on any of you?
MAN And... engage.
JEOR_MORMONT When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
JON_SNOW Soon, he says.
JEOR_MORMONT Good. You'll be ready for this then. I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear... So I had a new pommel made. It's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.
JON_SNOW This is Valyrian steel.
JEOR_MORMONT It was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. It was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.
JON_SNOW My Lord, you honor me, but I can't ...
JEOR_MORMONT Oh, you can and you will. I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me... So you'll take it. I'll hear no more about it. Is that understood?
JON_SNOW Yes, My Lord.
JEOR_MORMONT Right. Now don't think this means I approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword, it'll take a man to wield it.
JON_SNOW I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
JEOR_MORMONT No you won't! I sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist ... I've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this... Boy King. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.
JON_SNOW Yes, My Lord.
MAN_1 Well done.
MAN_2 Well done.
MAN_3 You earned that, Snow.
MAN_4 Well done.
PYPAR Go on, let's have a look.
JON_SNOW At what?
GRENN The sword! Show us the sword.
TOGETHER Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
MAN Let's have a look.
MAN Piss off.
MAN Get off of it. Piss off.
MAN Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light.
MAN Give it here!
JON_SNOW What is it?
MAN Look at its eyes.
MAN Give it.
SAMWELL_TARLY I ... I can't.
JON_SNOW You can't what?
SAMWELL_TARLY I ... I'm really not supposed to say.
JON_SNOW And yet you really want to say. You want to say that...?
SAMWELL_TARLY There was a raven. I read the message to Maester Aemon. It's your brother Robb.
JON_SNOW What? What about him?
SAMWELL_TARLY He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe.
JON_SNOW I should be there. I should be with him.
JON_UMBER ...If we do that, they'll never get back across.
ROBB_STARK Well? What did he say?
CATELYN_STARK Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours as well ...
JON_UMBER Huh.
CATELYN_STARK ... Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
ROBB_STARK And what does he want in return?
CATELYN_STARK You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
ROBB_STARK Fine fine. And?
CATELYN_STARK And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
ROBB_STARK She won't be happy about that. And?
CATELYN_STARK And when the fighting is done... You will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be... suitable.
ROBB_STARK I see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
CATELYN_STARK I did.
ROBB_STARK And?
CATELYN_STARK One was... Do you consent?
ROBB_STARK Can I refuse?
CATELYN_STARK Not if you want to cross.
ROBB_STARK Then I consent.
JON_SNOW Sam said you wanted to see me?
MAESTER_AEMON I did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of The Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?
JON_SNOW No.
MAESTER_AEMON So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
JON_SNOW He would do whatever was right. No matter what.
MAESTER_AEMON Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?
JON_SNOW Sam told you.
MAESTER_AEMON We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.
JON_SNOW And this is my day? Is that what you're saying?
MAESTER_AEMON Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh yes. I know.
JON_SNOW You do not know! No one knows. I may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
MAESTER_AEMON The Gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till I was old. What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South ... the ruin of my House, the death of my family? I was helpless, blind, frail. But when I heard they had killed my brother's son, and his poor son... And the children! Even the little children.
JON_SNOW Who are you?
MAESTER_AEMON My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when I had refused the Throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys, whom they called the Mad King.
JON_SNOW You're Aemon Targaryen.
MAESTER_AEMON I'm a Maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and The Night's Watch. I will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself, and live with it for the rest of your days. As I have.
KEVAN_LANNISTER Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
TYWIN_LANNISTER The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.
TYRION_LANNISTER Ah. Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.
TYWIN_LANNISTER I do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.
KEVAN_LANNISTER The great hairy one insisted he must have two battle axes ... heavy black steel, double-sided.
TYRION_LANNISTER Shagga likes axes.
TYWIN_LANNISTER When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.
TYRION_LANNISTER The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
KEVAN_LANNISTER They do seem rather ferocious.
TYRION_LANNISTER Ferocious? Last night a Moon brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
TYWIN_LANNISTER When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.
TYRION_LANNISTER Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
TYWIN_LANNISTER There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
TYRION_LANNISTER It appears I'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, My Lords.
TYRION_LANNISTER Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
BRONN I took her.
TYRION_LANNISTER Took her? From whom?
BRONN From, uh... Ser ... what's his name? I don't know. Ginger cunt three tents down.
TYRION_LANNISTER And he didn't have anything to say about it?
BRONN He said something.
TYRION_LANNISTER Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
BRONN Oh well. I... think I'll go and find myself one.
TYRION_LANNISTER Who are you?
SHAE Who would you like me to be?
TYRION_LANNISTER What did your mother call you?
SHAE Shae. What did your mother call you?
TYRION_LANNISTER My mother died giving birth to me.
SHAE Is that why I'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
TYRION_LANNISTER What sort of accent is that?
SHAE Foreign.
TYRION_LANNISTER For ...
SHAE What do you want from me?
TYRION_LANNISTER What do I want from you? I want you to share my tent. I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. I want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world ... which it may well be.
SHAE And what do I get?
TYRION_LANNISTER One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which I have heard is spectacular.
SHAE Who told you this? Women you paid?
TYRION_LANNISTER And three - More gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
SHAE Let's start with your last night in this world.
JORAH_MORMONT Khaleesi.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
JORAH_MORMONT He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN He can't. He can't. I won't let him.
JORAH_MORMONT Even a Queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. I've heard there's a good port in Asshai ...
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN I won't leave him.
JORAH_MORMONT He's already gone, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Even if ... even if he dies, why would I run? I am Khaleesi and my ... my son will be Khal after Drogo.
JORAH_MORMONT This isn't Westeros where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN I won't leave him.
MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR The wound has festered.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN I think you should wear your armor tonight, Ser.
JORAH_MORMONT I think you're right.
MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR You've saved me once more.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN And now you must save him.
MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR He's beyond the healer's skills. All I can do is ease his path.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Save him and I will free you. I swear it. You must know a way... Some... Some magic.
MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Do it. Save him.
MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR There is a price.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN You'll have gold ... whatever you want.
MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR It's not a matter of gold. This is Bloodmagic.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Only death pays for life. My death?
MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR No. Not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.
RAKHARO Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Kill her and you kill your Khal.
RAKHARO This is Bloodmagic. It is forbidden.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN I am your Khaleesi. I tell you what is forbidden.
MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR Go now!
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN Take her and leave. Take her!
RAKHARO Irriya?
MIRRI_MAZ_DUUR You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN No one will enter. Bring him back to me.
JORAH_MORMONT What have you done?
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN I have to save him.
JORAH_MORMONT We could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe.
IRRI Khaleesi!
JORAH_MORMONT Are you hurt?
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN The baby... is coming.
JORAH_MORMONT Fetch the midwives.
RAKHARO They will not come. They say she is cursed.
JORAH_MORMONT They'll come or I'll have their heads.
RAKHARO The witch ... she can bring baby. I hear her say so.
SHAE Are you in agony, my lion?
TYRION_LANNISTER No.
SHAE You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
TYRION_LANNISTER Ahhh. Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?
SHAE Just used to it.
BRONN Drink.
TYRION_LANNISTER Let's play a new game.
BRONN There's a Braavosi knife game I could teach you ...
TYRION_LANNISTER Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
BRONN Not if you win.
TYRION_LANNISTER No! No more fire games, no knife games. Let's do something I'm good at.
SHAE What are you good at?
TYRION_LANNISTER I happen to be a great judge of character.
BRONN This sounds like a boring game.
TYRION_LANNISTER It's not. Here's how it works - I make a statement about your past. If I'm right, you drink. If I'm wrong, I drink. And no lying. I'll know if you're lying.
SHAE I don't want to play this game.
TYRION_LANNISTER Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
BRONN But my mother hit harder.
TYRION_LANNISTER You killed your first man before you were 12.
BRONN It was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
TYRION_LANNISTER You've been North of the Wall.
SHAE What brought you up there?
BRONN Work.
TYRION_LANNISTER And... you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.
SHAE I don't want to play.
TYRION_LANNISTER It's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
SHAE Drink.
TYRION_LANNISTER All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.
SHAE Drink.
TYRION_LANNISTER And we've established the rules about lying?
SHAE Drink!
TYRION_LANNISTER Mmmm. You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
BRONN The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
TYRION_LANNISTER So specifics ... you wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? I don't believe the life of the silent sisters is for you. So what's a lowborn girl to do?
SHAE Drink.
TYRION_LANNISTER Are you sure ...
SHAE Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever or I will carve your eyes from your head.
TYRION_LANNISTER My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologize.
SHAE My turn.
TYRION_LANNISTER Fine fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
SHAE Who were you in love with?
TYRION_LANNISTER That's not how the game works. I don't care the way the game works.
BRONN Our Lord here used to be married.
SHAE Married?
TYRION_LANNISTER How did you hear that?
BRONN You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
TYRION_LANNISTER Another night, perhaps. Not another night. This night. It's not a pleasant story.
SHAE Or maybe I will cry.
BRONN I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your Lordship.
TYRION_LANNISTER So... I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers I took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry ... together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine. I forgot how afraid I was around girls, how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother. I forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow I found myself in her bed.
BRONN For three chickens, I should hope so.
TYRION_LANNISTER It didn't last long. I didn't know what the hell I was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken Septon and there you have it ... man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the Septon sobered up and told my father.
BRONN I imagine that was the end of all that.
TYRION_LANNISTER Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing, the road, the rapers ... all of it. He thought it was time I had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well ... a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling onto the floor.
BRONN I would have killed the man who did that to me.
SHAE You should have known she was a whore.
TYRION_LANNISTER Really? I was 16, drunk and in love ...
SHAE A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
TYRION_LANNISTER As I said, I was young and stupid.
SHAE You are still young and stupid.
TYRION_LANNISTER What is it? What do you want?
BRONN You're sleeping through the war.
TYRION_LANNISTER What?
BRONN They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
TYRION_LANNISTER Get my squire!
BRONN You don't have a squire.
TYRION_LANNISTER If I die, weep for me.
SHAE You'll be dead. How will you know?
TYRION_LANNISTER I'll know.
SOLDIER_1 Watch out! Move!
SOLDIER_2 Out of the way!
SOLDIER_3 Move aside!
BRONN Stay low.
TYRION_LANNISTER Stay low?
BRONN If you're lucky, no one will notice you.
TYRION_LANNISTER I was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon brothers!
MAN And painted dogs!
TYRION_LANNISTER And painted dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward to claim what is yours! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! To battle.
BRONN You're a shit warrior.
TYRION_LANNISTER I'm alive?
BRONN You're alive.
TYRION_LANNISTER Did we win?
BRONN We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
TYRION_LANNISTER How did our tribesmen do?
BRONN Yeah, good.
TYRION_LANNISTER It's nice to see them getting along.
TYWIN_LANNISTER You're wounded.
TYRION_LANNISTER Good of you to notice. I hear we won.
TYWIN_LANNISTER Hmph. The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20,000.
TYRION_LANNISTER Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
TYWIN_LANNISTER He wasn't here.
TYRION_LANNISTER Where was he?
TYWIN_LANNISTER With his other 18,000 men.
TYRION_LANNISTER And where are they?
RODRIK_CASSEL We should go, My Lady.
CATELYN_STARK No!
RODRIK_CASSEL My Lady!
ROBB_STARK By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.
JAIME_LANNISTER Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword, but I seem to have lost it.
CATELYN_STARK It's not your sword I want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
JAIME_LANNISTER I've lost them too, I'm afraid.
THEON_GREYJOY Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down 10 of our men ... you saw him.
ROBB_STARK He's more use to us alive than dead.
CATELYN_STARK Take him away and put him in irons.
JAIME_LANNISTER We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails ... choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.
ROBB_STARK If we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.
JON_UMBER Come on, pretty man.
ROBB_STARK I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
THEON_GREYJOY The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
ROBB_STARK Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the Queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
ARYA_STARK Could I have one? A lemon one ... or any of them.
BAKER Three coppers.
ARYA_STARK How about a nice fat pigeon?
BAKER Piss off now. Go on.
ARYA_STARK Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
BAKER Piss off!
ARYA_STARK Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?
BOY They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
ARYA_STARK Who?
BOY The Hand of the King.
CROWD Traitor! Coward!
EDDARD_STARK Baelor. Baelor!
CROWD Traitor! Traitor!
EDDARD_STARK I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son... And seize the Throne for myself.
CROWD Traitor!
EDDARD_STARK Let the high Septon and Baelor the blessed bear witness to what I say - Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the Grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
GRAND_MAESTER_PYCELLE As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
JOFFREY_BARATHEON My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!
