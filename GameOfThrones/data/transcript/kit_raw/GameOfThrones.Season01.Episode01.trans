WAYMAR ROYCE: What do you expect? They're savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they're ripping each other to pieces.
WILL: I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
WAYMAR ROYCE: How close did you get?
WILL: Close as any man would.
GARED: We should head back to the wall.
WAYMAR ROYCE: Do the dead frighten you?
GARED: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.
WAYMAR ROYCE: You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
WILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
WAYMAR ROYCE: It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter ... if I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again.
WAYMAR ROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
WILL: They were here.
GARED: See where they went.
WAYMAR ROYCE: What is it?
GARED: It's ...
JON SNOW: Go on. Father's watching.
JON SNOW: And your mother.
SEPTA MORDANE: Fine work, as always. Well done.
SANSA STARK: Thank you.
SEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. Quite beautiful ... the stitching ...
EDDARD STARK: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.
JON SNOW: Don't think too much, Bran.
ROBB STARK: Relax your bow arm.
ROBB STARK: Quick, Bran, faster!
RODRIK CASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
EDDARD STARK: Get the lads to saddle their horses.
CATELYN STARK: Do you have to?
EDDARD STARK: He swore an oath, Cat.
RODRIK CASSEL: The law is law, my lady.
EDDARD STARK: Tell Bran he's coming, too.
CATELYN STARK: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
EDDARD STARK: He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
ROBB STARK: Lad, go run back and get the rest.
WILL: White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.
WILL: I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry.
WILL: Forgive me, lord.
EDDARD STARK: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name ...
JON SNOW: Don't look away.
EDDARD STARK: King of the Andals and the First Men...
JON SNOW: Father will know if you do.
EDDARD STARK: Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
JON SNOW: You did well.
EDDARD STARK: You understand why I did it?
BRAN STARK: Jon said he was a deserter.
EDDARD STARK: But do you understand why I had to kill him?
BRAN STARK: Our way is the old way?
EDDARD STARK: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
BRAN STARK: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
EDDARD STARK: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
BRAN STARK: So he was lying?
EDDARD STARK: A madman sees what he sees.
JON SNOW: What is it?
THEON GREYJOY: Mountain lion?
EDDARD STARK: There are no mountain lions in these woods.
THEON GREYJOY: It's a freak.
EDDARD STARK: It's a direwolf.
EDDARD STARK: Tough old beast.
ROBB STARK: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
JON SNOW: Now there are five.
JON SNOW: You want to hold it?
BRAN STARK: Where will they go? Their mother's dead.
RODRIK CASSEL: They don't belong down here.
EDDARD STARK: Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.
THEON GREYJOY: Right. Give it here.
BRAN STARK: No!
ROBB STARK: Put away your blade.
THEON GREYJOY: I take orders from your father, not you.
BRAN STARK: Please, father!
EDDARD STARK: I'm sorry, Bran.
JON SNOW: Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
EDDARD STARK: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
BRAN STARK: What about you?
JON SNOW: I'm not a Stark. Get on.
ROBB STARK: What is it?
THEON GREYJOY: The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow.
JAIME LANNISTER: As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you. You worry too much. It's starting to show.
CERSEI LANNISTER: And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock. A hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.
JAIME LANNISTER: There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools.
CERSEI LANNISTER: What if Jon Arryn told someone?
JAIME LANNISTER: But who would he tell?
CERSEI LANNISTER: My husband.
JAIME LANNISTER: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.
CERSEI LANNISTER: You should be the Hand of the king.
JAIME LANNISTER: That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
CATELYN STARK: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
EDDARD STARK: You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.
CATELYN STARK: I wonder if the old gods agree.
EDDARD STARK: It's your gods with all the rules.
CATELYN STARK: I am so sorry, my love.
EDDARD STARK: Tell me.
CATELYN STARK: There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
EDDARD STARK: Your sister. The boy ...
CATELYN STARK: They both have their health. Gods be good. The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
EDDARD STARK: If he's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after.
CATELYN STARK: You can always say no, Ned.
CATELYN STARK: We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
MAESTER LUWIN: I'm told he drinks all night.
CATELYN STARK: How much could he possibly drink? A man of his ... stature.
MAESTER LUWIN: We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
CATELYN STARK: In any case, candles.
JON SNOW: Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
THEON GREYJOY: It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's sleek bit of mink?
ROBB STARK: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
THEON GREYJOY: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
ROBB STARK: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
CATELYN STARK: Gods, but they grow fast. Brandon!
BRAN STARK: I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
CATELYN STARK: How many times have I told you: No climbing!
BRAN STARK: But he's coming right now! Down our road!
CATELYN STARK: I want you to promise me: No more climbing.
BRAN STARK: I promise.
CATELYN STARK: Do you know what?
BRAN STARK: What?
CATELYN STARK: You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
CATELYN STARK: Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?
EDDARD STARK: Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? Go on.
ARYA STARK: Move!
EDDARD STARK: Your Grace.
ROBERT BARATHEON: You've got fat.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Cat!
CATELYN STARK: Your Grace.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
EDDARD STARK: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
ARYA STARK: Where's the Imp?
SANSA STARK: Will you shut up?
ROBERT BARATHEON: Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?
ARYA STARK: Arya.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
ARYA STARK: That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
SANSA STARK: Would you please shut up.
EDDARD STARK: My queen.
CATELYN STARK: My queen.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
CERSEI LANNISTER: We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Ned.
ARYA STARK: Where's the Imp?
CERSEI LANNISTER: Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
EDDARD STARK: Tell me about Jon Arryn.
ROBERT BARATHEON: One minute he was fine, and then ... Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.
EDDARD STARK: We both did.
ROBERT BARATHEON: He never had to teach you much, but me ... You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.
EDDARD STARK: Aye.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.
EDDARD STARK: I'm not worthy of the honor.
ROBERT BARATHEON: I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses.
TYRION LANNISTER: Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
ROS: Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
TYRION LANNISTER: I did hear something about that.
ROS: And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
TYRION LANNISTER: And the other brother?
ROS: The queen has two brothers?
TYRION LANNISTER: There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
ROS: I hear they call him the Imp.
TYRION LANNISTER: I hear he hates that nickname.
ROS: Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
TYRION LANNISTER: Clever girl.
ROS: We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
TYRION LANNISTER: Have you?
TYRION LANNISTER: The gods gave me one blessing.
JAIME LANNISTER: Don't get up.
ROS: M'lord.
TYRION LANNISTER: Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
JAIME LANNISTER: You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.
TYRION LANNISTER: She has odd cravings, our sister.
JAIME LANNISTER: A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people.
TYRION LANNISTER: I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.
JAIME LANNISTER: I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown.
TYRION LANNISTER: Close the door!
ROBERT BARATHEON: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
EDDARD STARK: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
ROBERT BARATHEON: She belonged with me. In my dreams, I kill him every night.
EDDARD STARK: It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Not all of them.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Daenerys!
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look - a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Go on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: No.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
MAID: It's too hot, my lady.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Where is he?
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: Come forward, my dear.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Where's he going?
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: The ceremony is over.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know.
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: When will they be married?
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Is it true they lie with their horses?
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Do you take me for a fool?
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I don't know.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took.
SANSA STARK: Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
CATELYN STARK: Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
SANSA STARK: He's so handsome.
SANSA STARK: When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
CATELYN STARK: Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
SANSA STARK: Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
CATELYN STARK: He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
SANSA STARK: You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
CATELYN STARK: Sansa ...
SANSA STARK: Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted.
BENJEN STARK: Is he dead yet?
JON SNOW: Uncle Benjen!
BENJEN STARK: You got bigger. Rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
JON SNOW: Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
BENJEN STARK: Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
JON SNOW: So take me with you when you go back.
BENJEN STARK: Jon ...
JON SNOW: Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.
BENJEN STARK: The Wall isn't going anywhere.
JON SNOW: I'm ready to swear your oath.
BENJEN STARK: You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
JON SNOW: I don't care about that.
BENJEN STARK: You might, if you knew what it meant. I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later.
TYRION LANNISTER: Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
JON SNOW: What're you doing back there?
TYRION LANNISTER: Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
JON SNOW: You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
TYRION LANNISTER: My greatest accomplishment. You - you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?
TYRION LANNISTER: Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.
JON SNOW: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
TYRION LANNISTER: And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.
JON SNOW: What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
TYRION LANNISTER: All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
BENJEN STARK: You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
EDDARD STARK: The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
BENJEN STARK: Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.
EDDARD STARK: He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
BENJEN STARK: The two he was with are still missing.
EDDARD STARK: A wildling ambush.
BENJEN STARK: Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
EDDARD STARK: Winter is coming.
ROBB STARK: Uncle Benjen.
BENJEN STARK: Robb boy. How are you?
ROBB STARK: I'm good.
CATELYN STARK: Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
CERSEI LANNISTER: Yes. Lovely country.
CATELYN STARK: I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
CERSEI LANNISTER: Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?
SANSA STARK: Thirteen, Your Grace.
CERSEI LANNISTER: You're tall. Still growing?
SANSA STARK: I think so, Your Grace.
CERSEI LANNISTER: And have you bled yet?
SANSA STARK: No, Your Grace.
CERSEI LANNISTER: And your dress. Did you make it?
CERSEI LANNISTER: Such talent. You must make something for me.
CERSEI LANNISTER: I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
CATELYN STARK: I hear the same.
CERSEI LANNISTER: Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
EDDARD STARK: Your pardon.
JAIME LANNISTER: I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
EDDARD STARK: Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.
JAIME LANNISTER: I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.
EDDARD STARK: I don't fight in tournaments.
JAIME LANNISTER: No? Getting a little old for it?
EDDARD STARK: I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do.
JAIME LANNISTER: Well said.
SANSA STARK: Arya!
ROBB STARK: Time for bed.
EDDARD STARK: I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital.
CATELYN STARK: I won't let him take you.
EDDARD STARK: The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
CATELYN STARK: I'll say, 'Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'
EDDARD STARK: How did he get so fat?
CATELYN STARK: He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
GUARD: It's Maester Luwin, my lord.
EDDARD STARK: Send him in.
MAESTER LUWIN: Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.
EDDARD STARK: Stay.
CATELYN STARK: This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
EDDARD STARK: What news?
CATELYN STARK: She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
EDDARD STARK: She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying.
CATELYN STARK: Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?
MAESTER LUWIN: If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
CATELYN STARK: They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
MAESTER LUWIN: The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.
CATELYN STARK: He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
MAESTER LUWIN: A different time. Different king.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: When?
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: When their omens favor war.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
JORAH MORMONT: A small gift, for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?
JORAH MORMONT: Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.
ILLYRIO MOPATIS: Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Thank you, Magister.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: She's beautiful. ... Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say 'thank you' in Dothraki.
JORAH MORMONT: There is no word for 'thank you' in Dothraki.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Make him happy.
KHAL DROGO: No.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Do you know the Common Tongue?
KHAL DROGO: No.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Is 'no' the only word that you know?
KHAL DROGO: No.
SANDOR CLEGANE: Rough night, Imp?
TYRION LANNISTER: If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.
SANDOR CLEGANE: I didn't pick you for a hunter.
TYRION LANNISTER: The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
SANDOR CLEGANE: It's not hunting if you pay for it.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
EDDARD STARK: No, but I'm still better than you.
ROBERT BARATHEON: I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
EDDARD STARK: I hope I'll serve you well.
ROBERT BARATHEON: You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!
BRAN STARK: Come on, you.
CERSEI LANNISTER: Stop. Stop!
JAIME LANNISTER: Are you completely mad?
CERSEI LANNISTER: He saw us.
JAIME LANNISTER: It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
CERSEI LANNISTER: He saw us!
JAIME LANNISTER: I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?
BRAN STARK: Ten.
JAIME LANNISTER: Ten.
JAIME LANNISTER: The things I do for love.
