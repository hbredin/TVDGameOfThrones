VARYS: You've seen better days, My Lord.
EDDARD STARK: Another visit? It seems you're my last friend.
VARYS: No no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
EDDARD STARK: On her knees, begging for me, hmmm. Did you laugh with the others?
VARYS: You do me wrong, My Lord. Your blood is the last thing I want.
EDDARD STARK: I don't know what you want. I've given up trying to guess.
VARYS: When I was still a boy ... before they cut my balls off with a hot knife ... I traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. I am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. I'm a good actor, My Lord.
EDDARD STARK: Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
VARYS: I could. But will I? No. As I said, I'm no hero.
EDDARD STARK: What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories ... tell me, what do you want?
VARYS: Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad ... fighting for his father's freedom.
EDDARD STARK: Robb? He's just a boy.
VARYS: Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the King's ... the late King's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the Throne, he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
EDDARD STARK: Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The Throne is his by rights.
VARYS: Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life, it would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
EDDARD STARK: You want me to serve the woman who murdered my King, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
VARYS: I want you to serve the realm! Tell the Queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. If you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave, I believe she will allow you to take the Black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
EDDARD STARK: You think my life is some precious thing to me? That I would trade my honor for a few more years of... Of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learned it well. But I grew up with soldiers. I learned how to die a long time ago.
VARYS: Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, My Lord? Is that a precious thing to you?
ROBB STARK: It's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
THEON GREYJOY: Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
CATELYN STARK: Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
ROBB STARK: He's grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
JON UMBER: Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
ROBB STARK: Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
THEON GREYJOY: Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
RODRIK CASSEL: Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
CATELYN STARK: The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.
ROBB STARK: Have my horse saddled and ready.
JON UMBER: Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannis.
THEON GREYJOY: Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
ROBB STARK: My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.
CATELYN STARK: I agree. I'll go.
THEON GREYJOY: You can't!
CATELYN STARK: I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl. He would never harm me.
JON UMBER: Unless there was a profit in it.
WALDER FREY: What do you want?
CATELYN STARK: It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, My Lord.
WALDER FREY: Oh spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am I supposed to do with you?
FREY SON 1: Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here ...
WALDER FREY: Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until I die. Do I look dead to you?
FREY SON 2: Father, please ...
WALDER FREY: I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if I hadn't squirted you into her belly. All right, you come forward. There. Now that I've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.
CATELYN STARK: Is there somewhere we can talk?
WALDER FREY: We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you! You too. You see that? 15 she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine.
CATELYN STARK: I'm sure she will give you many sons.
WALDER FREY: Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
CATELYN STARK: He is quite ill, My Lord.
WALDER FREY: Didn't come to the last one either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.
CATELYN STARK: My Lord, I ...
WALDER FREY: Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
CATELYN STARK: I'm sure there were reasons why ...
WALDER FREY: I didn't need reasons. I needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
CATELYN STARK: To ask you to open your gates, My Lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
WALDER FREY: Why should I let him?
CATELYN STARK: If you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.
WALDER FREY: They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.
CATELYN STARK: You swore an oath to my father.
WALDER FREY: Oh yes, I said some words... And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right. Joffrey's King now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. If I had the sense the Gods gave a fish, I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.
CATELYN STARK: Why don't you?
WALDER FREY: Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon, give me one good reason why I should waste a single thought on any of you?
MAN: And... engage.
JEOR MORMONT: When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
JON SNOW: Soon, he says.
JEOR MORMONT: Good. You'll be ready for this then. I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear... So I had a new pommel made. It's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.
JON SNOW: This is Valyrian steel.
JEOR MORMONT: It was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. It was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.
JON SNOW: My Lord, you honor me, but I can't ...
JEOR MORMONT: Oh, you can and you will. I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me... So you'll take it. I'll hear no more about it. Is that understood?
JON SNOW: Yes, My Lord.
JEOR MORMONT: Right. Now don't think this means I approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword, it'll take a man to wield it.
JON SNOW: I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
JEOR MORMONT: No you won't! I sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist ... I've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this... Boy King. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.
JON SNOW: Yes, My Lord.
MAN 1: Well done.
MAN 2: Well done.
MAN 3: You earned that, Snow.
MAN 4: Well done.
PYPAR: Go on, let's have a look.
JON SNOW: At what?
GRENN: The sword! Show us the sword.
TOGETHER: Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
MAN: Let's have a look.
MAN: Piss off.
MAN: Get off of it. Piss off.
MAN: Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light.
MAN: Give it here!
JON SNOW: What is it?
MAN: Look at its eyes.
MAN: Give it.
SAMWELL TARLY: I ... I can't.
JON SNOW: You can't what?
SAMWELL TARLY: I ... I'm really not supposed to say.
JON SNOW: And yet you really want to say. You want to say that...?
SAMWELL TARLY: There was a raven. I read the message to Maester Aemon. It's your brother Robb.
JON SNOW: What? What about him?
SAMWELL TARLY: He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe.
JON SNOW: I should be there. I should be with him.
JON UMBER: ...If we do that, they'll never get back across.
ROBB STARK: Well? What did he say?
CATELYN STARK: Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours as well ...
JON UMBER: Huh.
CATELYN STARK: ... Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
ROBB STARK: And what does he want in return?
CATELYN STARK: You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
ROBB STARK: Fine fine. And?
CATELYN STARK: And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
ROBB STARK: She won't be happy about that. And?
CATELYN STARK: And when the fighting is done... You will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be... suitable.
ROBB STARK: I see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
CATELYN STARK: I did.
ROBB STARK: And?
CATELYN STARK: One was... Do you consent?
ROBB STARK: Can I refuse?
CATELYN STARK: Not if you want to cross.
ROBB STARK: Then I consent.
JON SNOW: Sam said you wanted to see me?
MAESTER AEMON: I did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of The Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?
JON SNOW: No.
MAESTER AEMON: So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
JON SNOW: He would do whatever was right. No matter what.
MAESTER AEMON: Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?
JON SNOW: Sam told you.
MAESTER AEMON: We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.
JON SNOW: And this is my day? Is that what you're saying?
MAESTER AEMON: Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh yes. I know.
JON SNOW: You do not know! No one knows. I may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
MAESTER AEMON: The Gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till I was old. What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South ... the ruin of my House, the death of my family? I was helpless, blind, frail. But when I heard they had killed my brother's son, and his poor son... And the children! Even the little children.
JON SNOW: Who are you?
MAESTER AEMON: My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when I had refused the Throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys, whom they called the Mad King.
JON SNOW: You're Aemon Targaryen.
MAESTER AEMON: I'm a Maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and The Night's Watch. I will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself, and live with it for the rest of your days. As I have.
KEVAN LANNISTER: Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
TYWIN LANNISTER: The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.
TYRION LANNISTER: Ah. Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.
TYWIN LANNISTER: I do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.
KEVAN LANNISTER: The great hairy one insisted he must have two battle axes ... heavy black steel, double-sided.
TYRION LANNISTER: Shagga likes axes.
TYWIN LANNISTER: When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.
TYRION LANNISTER: The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
KEVAN LANNISTER: They do seem rather ferocious.
TYRION LANNISTER: Ferocious? Last night a Moon brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
TYWIN LANNISTER: When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.
TYRION LANNISTER: Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
TYWIN LANNISTER: There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
TYRION LANNISTER: It appears I'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, My Lords.
TYRION LANNISTER: Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
BRONN: I took her.
TYRION LANNISTER: Took her? From whom?
BRONN: From, uh... Ser ... what's his name? I don't know. Ginger cunt three tents down.
TYRION LANNISTER: And he didn't have anything to say about it?
BRONN: He said something.
TYRION LANNISTER: Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
BRONN: Oh well. I... think I'll go and find myself one.
TYRION LANNISTER: Who are you?
SHAE: Who would you like me to be?
TYRION LANNISTER: What did your mother call you?
SHAE: Shae. What did your mother call you?
TYRION LANNISTER: My mother died giving birth to me.
SHAE: Is that why I'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
TYRION LANNISTER: What sort of accent is that?
SHAE: Foreign.
TYRION LANNISTER: For ...
SHAE: What do you want from me?
TYRION LANNISTER: What do I want from you? I want you to share my tent. I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. I want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world ... which it may well be.
SHAE: And what do I get?
TYRION LANNISTER: One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which I have heard is spectacular.
SHAE: Who told you this? Women you paid?
TYRION LANNISTER: And three - More gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
SHAE: Let's start with your last night in this world.
JORAH MORMONT: Khaleesi.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
JORAH MORMONT: He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: He can't. He can't. I won't let him.
JORAH MORMONT: Even a Queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. I've heard there's a good port in Asshai ...
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I won't leave him.
JORAH MORMONT: He's already gone, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Even if ... even if he dies, why would I run? I am Khaleesi and my ... my son will be Khal after Drogo.
JORAH MORMONT: This isn't Westeros where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I won't leave him.
MIRRI MAZ DUUR: The wound has festered.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I think you should wear your armor tonight, Ser.
JORAH MORMONT: I think you're right.
MIRRI MAZ DUUR: You've saved me once more.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: And now you must save him.
MIRRI MAZ DUUR: He's beyond the healer's skills. All I can do is ease his path.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Save him and I will free you. I swear it. You must know a way... Some... Some magic.
MIRRI MAZ DUUR: There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Do it. Save him.
MIRRI MAZ DUUR: There is a price.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: You'll have gold ... whatever you want.
MIRRI MAZ DUUR: It's not a matter of gold. This is Bloodmagic.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Only death pays for life. My death?
MIRRI MAZ DUUR: No. Not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.
RAKHARO: Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Kill her and you kill your Khal.
RAKHARO: This is Bloodmagic. It is forbidden.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I am your Khaleesi. I tell you what is forbidden.
MIRRI MAZ DUUR: Go now!
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Take her and leave. Take her!
RAKHARO: Irriya?
MIRRI MAZ DUUR: You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: No one will enter. Bring him back to me.
JORAH MORMONT: What have you done?
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I have to save him.
JORAH MORMONT: We could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe.
IRRI: Khaleesi!
JORAH MORMONT: Are you hurt?
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: The baby... is coming.
JORAH MORMONT: Fetch the midwives.
RAKHARO: They will not come. They say she is cursed.
JORAH MORMONT: They'll come or I'll have their heads.
RAKHARO: The witch ... she can bring baby. I hear her say so.
SHAE: Are you in agony, my lion?
TYRION LANNISTER: No.
SHAE: You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
TYRION LANNISTER: Ahhh. Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?
SHAE: Just used to it.
BRONN: Drink.
TYRION LANNISTER: Let's play a new game.
BRONN: There's a Braavosi knife game I could teach you ...
TYRION LANNISTER: Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
BRONN: Not if you win.
TYRION LANNISTER: No! No more fire games, no knife games. Let's do something I'm good at.
SHAE: What are you good at?
TYRION LANNISTER: I happen to be a great judge of character.
BRONN: This sounds like a boring game.
TYRION LANNISTER: It's not. Here's how it works - I make a statement about your past. If I'm right, you drink. If I'm wrong, I drink. And no lying. I'll know if you're lying.
SHAE: I don't want to play this game.
TYRION LANNISTER: Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
BRONN: But my mother hit harder.
TYRION LANNISTER: You killed your first man before you were 12.
BRONN: It was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
TYRION LANNISTER: You've been North of the Wall.
SHAE: What brought you up there?
BRONN: Work.
TYRION LANNISTER: And... you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.
SHAE: I don't want to play.
TYRION LANNISTER: It's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
SHAE: Drink.
TYRION LANNISTER: All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.
SHAE: Drink.
TYRION LANNISTER: And we've established the rules about lying?
SHAE: Drink!
TYRION LANNISTER: Mmmm. You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
BRONN: The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
TYRION LANNISTER: So specifics ... you wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? I don't believe the life of the silent sisters is for you. So what's a lowborn girl to do?
SHAE: Drink.
TYRION LANNISTER: Are you sure ...
SHAE: Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever or I will carve your eyes from your head.
TYRION LANNISTER: My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologize.
SHAE: My turn.
TYRION LANNISTER: Fine fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
SHAE: Who were you in love with?
TYRION LANNISTER: That's not how the game works. I don't care the way the game works.
BRONN: Our Lord here used to be married.
SHAE: Married?
TYRION LANNISTER: How did you hear that?
BRONN: You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
TYRION LANNISTER: Another night, perhaps. Not another night. This night. It's not a pleasant story.
SHAE: Or maybe I will cry.
BRONN: I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your Lordship.
TYRION LANNISTER: So... I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers I took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry ... together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine. I forgot how afraid I was around girls, how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother. I forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow I found myself in her bed.
BRONN: For three chickens, I should hope so.
TYRION LANNISTER: It didn't last long. I didn't know what the hell I was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken Septon and there you have it ... man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the Septon sobered up and told my father.
BRONN: I imagine that was the end of all that.
TYRION LANNISTER: Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing, the road, the rapers ... all of it. He thought it was time I had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well ... a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling onto the floor.
BRONN: I would have killed the man who did that to me.
SHAE: You should have known she was a whore.
TYRION LANNISTER: Really? I was 16, drunk and in love ...
SHAE: A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
TYRION LANNISTER: As I said, I was young and stupid.
SHAE: You are still young and stupid.
TYRION LANNISTER: What is it? What do you want?
BRONN: You're sleeping through the war.
TYRION LANNISTER: What?
BRONN: They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
TYRION LANNISTER: Get my squire!
BRONN: You don't have a squire.
TYRION LANNISTER: If I die, weep for me.
SHAE: You'll be dead. How will you know?
TYRION LANNISTER: I'll know.
SOLDIER 1: Watch out! Move!
SOLDIER 2: Out of the way!
SOLDIER 3: Move aside!
BRONN: Stay low.
TYRION LANNISTER: Stay low?
BRONN: If you're lucky, no one will notice you.
TYRION LANNISTER: I was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon brothers!
MAN: And painted dogs!
TYRION LANNISTER: And painted dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward to claim what is yours! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! To battle.
BRONN: You're a shit warrior.
TYRION LANNISTER: I'm alive?
BRONN: You're alive.
TYRION LANNISTER: Did we win?
BRONN: We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
TYRION LANNISTER: How did our tribesmen do?
BRONN: Yeah, good.
TYRION LANNISTER: It's nice to see them getting along.
TYWIN LANNISTER: You're wounded.
TYRION LANNISTER: Good of you to notice. I hear we won.
TYWIN LANNISTER: Hmph. The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20,000.
TYRION LANNISTER: Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
TYWIN LANNISTER: He wasn't here.
TYRION LANNISTER: Where was he?
TYWIN LANNISTER: With his other 18,000 men.
TYRION LANNISTER: And where are they?
RODRIK CASSEL: We should go, My Lady.
CATELYN STARK: No!
RODRIK CASSEL: My Lady!
ROBB STARK: By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.
JAIME LANNISTER: Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword, but I seem to have lost it.
CATELYN STARK: It's not your sword I want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
JAIME LANNISTER: I've lost them too, I'm afraid.
THEON GREYJOY: Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down 10 of our men ... you saw him.
ROBB STARK: He's more use to us alive than dead.
CATELYN STARK: Take him away and put him in irons.
JAIME LANNISTER: We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails ... choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.
ROBB STARK: If we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.
JON UMBER: Come on, pretty man.
ROBB STARK: I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
THEON GREYJOY: The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
ROBB STARK: Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the Queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
ARYA STARK: Could I have one? A lemon one ... or any of them.
BAKER: Three coppers.
ARYA STARK: How about a nice fat pigeon?
BAKER: Piss off now. Go on.
ARYA STARK: Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
BAKER: Piss off!
ARYA STARK: Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?
BOY: They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
ARYA STARK: Who?
BOY: The Hand of the King.
CROWD: Traitor! Coward!
EDDARD STARK: Baelor. Baelor!
CROWD: Traitor! Traitor!
EDDARD STARK: I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son... And seize the Throne for myself.
CROWD: Traitor!
EDDARD STARK: Let the high Septon and Baelor the blessed bear witness to what I say - Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the Grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
JOFFREY BARATHEON: My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!
CERSEI LANNISTER: No! Stop!
SANSA STARK: Daddy! Someone stop him!
CERSEI LANNISTER: My son, this is madness.
JANOS SLYNT: Put him down!
YOREN: Don't look!
ARYA STARK: Let me go. Let me go!
YOREN: Shut your mouth. Look at me. Look at me!
SANSA STARK: Stop! Daddy! Stop! No no!
CROWD: Traitor!
SANSA STARK: Stop! Stop him, stop!
